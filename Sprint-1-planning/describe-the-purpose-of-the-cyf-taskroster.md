## 📌 Project Purpose: CYF-TaskRoster

### ✏️ What does the app do?

This app allows trainees to sign up for specific tasks, such as bringing food, buying supplies, or taking responsibility for cleaning duties, helping us stay organised and share responsibilities fairly during our Saturdays and weekly workshops.

For example, this week, persons A, B, and C might sign up to bring food, while W, X, and Y take responsibility for managing the cleaning—both after lunch and at the end of the day.

Of course, everyone helps out, but having three designated people makes sure the tasks are managed and nothing gets missed.

### 🧑‍🤝‍👩 Who is the app for?

This app is designed primarily for **CodeYourFuture trainees**, but **volunteers and mentors** can also use it to register for food and cleaning tasks.

It’s meant for anyone involved in our in-person sessions who wants to take part in keeping the day running smoothly—whether that means bringing food, helping with cleanup, or just supporting the team spirit.

### 💡 Why is it helpful?

The CYF-TaskRoster app is helpful because it:

- ✅ **Keeps the rota fair and clear** – everyone gets a chance to contribute without overloading the same people.
- 👀 **Shows who is responsible for what** – so there’s no guessing or awkward moments.
- ⏳ **Reduces last-minute confusion** – tasks are planned in advance, which means less stress on the day.
- 🤝 **Encourages teamwork and accountability** – when people commit to a task, they’re more likely to follow through.
- 🍽️ **Helps make Saturdays smoother and more enjoyable** – from food planning to end-of-day cleanup, everything runs better when it's organised!
