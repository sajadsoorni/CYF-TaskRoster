# User Stories for CYF-TaskRoster

This document outlines how users are expected to interact with the CYF-TaskRoster app. These user stories help guide development based on real user needs and scenarios.

---

## 👤 Trainee Stories

- As a trainee, I want to **sign up for a food or cleaning task**, so that I can contribute to my team's responsibilities.
- As a trainee, I want to **view the list of submitted tasks**, so I can see who has already signed up.
- As a trainee, I want to **remove my name from the list**, so that someone else can take over if I can't make it.
- As a trainee, I want to **filter tasks by category (food or cleaning)**, so I can quickly find my responsibilities.

## 👩‍💼 Admin Stories

- As an admin, I want to **remove tasks that are duplicates or incorrect**, so the list stays clean.
- As an admin, I want to **edit existing tasks**, so I can make corrections without deleting them.
- As an admin, I want to **manage all tasks** without logging in as each user.

These user stories may expand as the app grows in functionality. For now, they represent the primary expected interactions for MVP and early development.
