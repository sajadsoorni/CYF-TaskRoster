## 👤 Trainee Stories

- As a trainee, I want to **sign up for a food or cleaning task**, so that I can contribute to my team's responsibilities.
- As a trainee, I want to **view the list of submitted tasks**, so I can see who has already signed up.
- As a trainee, I want to **remove my name from the list**, so that someone else can take over if I can't make it.
- As a trainee, I want to **filter tasks by category (food or cleaning)**, so I can quickly find my responsibilities.
- As a trainee, I want to **volunteer for food duty even if others already signed up**, so I have a fair chance to be selected based on past participation.

## 👩‍💼 Admin Stories

- As an admin, I want to **remove tasks that are duplicates or incorrect**, so the list stays clean.
- As an admin, I want to **edit existing tasks**, so I can make corrections without deleting them.
- As an admin, I want to **manage all tasks** without logging in as each user.
- As an admin, I want to **see all food duty volunteers and select 3 with the least participation**, so the rota stays fair and balanced.

## 🔄 Notes on Selection Process

The app will allow more than 3 trainees to volunteer for food or cleaning task. Once the submission period ends, the admin will review all entries and select 3 participants based on who has:
- Never participated before, or
- Participated the fewest number of times

This ensures fairness and equal opportunity for all trainees to take part in weekly responsibilities.
