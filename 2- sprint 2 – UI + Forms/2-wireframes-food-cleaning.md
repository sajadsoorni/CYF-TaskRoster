## 🧱 Step 2 – Create Wireframes for Food + Cleaning Form Pages

### 🎯 Goal:

Visualize the structure of the Food and Cleaning forms before development. Wireframes will help identify layout needs, form sections, and user flow.

### 📌 Tasks:

- Sketch or design wireframes (mobile + desktop views) for:
  - Food contribution form
  - Cleaning responsibility form
- Include fields like dropdowns, checkboxes, and notes sections.
- Consider visual hierarchy, spacing, and ease of use.
- Use tools like Figma, Excalidraw, or pen-and-paper.

### 📈 Outcome:

Clear and well-organized wireframes for both form pages. These will serve as visual references for building the components in the next steps.
